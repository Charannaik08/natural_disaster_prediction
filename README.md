# natural_disaster_prediction

The goal of this project is to develop a reliable machine learning-based system for predicting natural disasters by analyzing a comprehensive historical dataset covering the period from 1900 to 2021. Through the use of machine learning algorithms, we aim to better understand the complex patterns and contributing factors that lead to various types of natural disasters, ultimately improving our ability to forecast and respond to these occurrences
